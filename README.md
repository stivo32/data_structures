# Searing algorithms

## Binary search

BS needs a sorted list to perform searching. It starts searching the item by dividing the given list by half. If the
search item is smaller than the middle value then it will look for the searched item only in the first half of the list,
and if the search item is greater than the middle value it will only look at the second half of the list. We repeat the
same process every time until we find the search item or we have checked the whole list.
